      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <p> Hello! My name is Mason Maile, and I am a junior mechanical engineering student at MSOE, also minoring in electrical engineering. People often say that when you 
        do what you love, you never work a day in your life, and that’s exactly what I’m chasing. For me, engineering doesn’t feel like work at all, it’s something I genuinely love. Whether 
        it’s designing, building, or problem-solving, I find myself fully immersed in the process.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, my goal is to work for a company that mirrors this same passion. I want to be part of a team that creates products people notice, things that make someone stop and 
say, “That’s cool.” More importantly, I want to help design products that actually improve the lives of their users. To me, that’s what engineering is all about: combining innovation, 
impact, and creativity in a way that truly makes a difference.  
</p></p>

      <h2>My Approach To Engineering</h2>
      <p id="aboutText">
        <p> I’ve come to realize that the true joy of engineering lies less in the destination and more in the journey. The late nights spent problem-solving,
         the roadblocks that force creative solutions, and the small breakthroughs along the way are what give every project its meaning. Each challenge isn’t 
         just an obstacle to overcome but an opportunity to grow, and it’s that process that makes engineering so rewarding to me.</p>

      <p>The projects above reflect this mindset. Every one of them pushed me in new ways, teaching me lessons that went far beyond the technical side. They don’t just show what I 
        built, they capture the experiences, the problem-solving, and the growth that came with creating something meaningful.</p>

        <h3>The Origin of G.U.N.T.H.E.R</h3>
        <p> G.U.N.T.H.E.R is an autonomous Nerf turret powered by a Raspberry Pi 5 and an integrated camera system, using YOLOv8 pose detection to track and 
          engage human targets in real time. This project was a collaborative effort between my friend Braden Everson and me: Braden developed all the software 
          and tracking logic, while I handled the mechanical and electrical design. </p>

          <p> But G.U.N.T.H.E.R didn’t start out this advanced — not even close. </p>

          <p> Originally we set out to build a simple one-week prototype during finals week to prank our dormmates using a single-shot Nerf gun.
          However, after finding a sickening amount of joy in remotely sniping our friends and fully awakening our inner child, we knew we couldn’t stop there. 
          Turning a small prank into a fully-fledged, overengineered autonomous turret felt like the only logical next step. The images and videos below show this early stage "prototype". </p>

          <p> With this orignal design being built under an aggressive one week timeline, with a priortization on funciton over form, it was undeniably rudimentry.However, I’ve learned that 
          rapidly creating a rough minimum viable product is one of the most effective ways to capture the vision and drive decisions. So, even with its exposed servos and less then hidden wires,
          we were able to gain valuable feedback in terms of what we liked, didnt like, and wanted to add. </p>

          <p> From this early stage prototype we identified a few core things to keep - the tri-pod mounted form factor, live-feed, and optional manual control capabilities - but we also noted
             several important shortcomings.The turret’s horizontal rotation felt sluggish,
              the gun mount lacked rigidity, and the blaster’s slow single-fire rate severely limited engagement effectiveness. Thus, for the next iteration we knew we needed to add autonomous 
              tracking, a faster, auto-firing Nerf gun with a higher ammo capacity, a redesigned gun mount for much greater stiffness, an increased horizontal rotation speed, and a 
              vertical aiming axis so the system could better track the dynamic movements of a person.</p>

          <p>The images below show an early stage of the development phase for prototype two. At this point we switched to a fully automatic electronic Nerf blaster and reworked the tripod-to-gun interface. 
            Additionally, we designed a custom 3D-printed bearing assembly to take the gun’s weight and moment off the rotation mechanism, and replaced the original stepper with a high-torque 35 kg·cm servo. 
            This design change was driven by practical limits. Without a gear reduction and running at low voltage, the stepper could not deliver the torque or positional reliability we needed. 
            Switching to a high-torque servo gave us accurate position control and enough strength to handle the impulses and momentum from rapid rotations and direction changes. We retained a servo-based 
            trigger mechanism, but the new blaster required a full redesign since it had separate rev and trigger inputs. To solve this, we integrated a dual-actuation servo system that could independently 
            control both functions. The result at this stage was a much stiffer, more controllable firing platform. However, we still needed to integrate the autonomous tracking capabilites. </p>

          <p> With a solid working foundation for prototype two, we moved on to define and test the major additions we wanted. The first priority was a much larger ammunition system. Although the new 
            blaster already held more rounds than prototype one, its 50-round capacity emptied almost instantly with the gun’s 10 rounds-per-second fire rate. So increasing storage became essential if extended operation
            was to be achieved. My initial idea was to go the simplest route and just mount a larger hopper on top of the blaster. The image below shows that first concept.
            </p>

            <div class="gallery">
           
          <h4> V2 Prototype Initial Hopper Design Concept </h4>
          <div></div>
          <img src="./Hopper Proto 2.JPG" alt="CAD v1">
          </div>


            <p> However, A few immediate problems emerged with the top-mounted hopper. The added mass significantly increased the system’s rotational inertia and pushed 
              the belt-driven servo-controlled horizontal rotation mechanism to its limits. Worse, the blaster’s feed geometry required active shaking to get rounds to drop reliably; with 
              a larger hopper that issue was amplified and the feed would jam after just a couple seconds of firing. With these results, I went back to the drawing board.

            <p> While at first I thought this issue would be rather simple to solve, it turned out to be one of the most interesitng and thought-intensive parts of the build. As I found out,
              its actually quite difficult to move objects from a position of lower height to a higher one, and involves a lot of fluids and thermo based calculations to do so. With that said, my new idea was to
              use a brushless motor to create a high pressure blower fan to presurize an ammunition chamber and force rounds up a tube connected to the chamber into the gun. In order to make this concept a reality,
              , I had to first learn SolidWorks Flow Simulation and the fundamentals of high-pressure fan design. After that, I created a blower design in CAD and tweaked it according to the Flow Simulation results
              the design until the SolidWorks flow simulations produced the output pressure required by my calculations. The images below depict this part of the process. </p>

          <p> With the SOLIDWORKS Flow Simulation results giving me enough confidence in the blower concept, I then got to grinding on further developing the CAD into a fully funcitoning blower design which
          I could 3D print and place hardware into to get physical results from. The images and videos below portray this part of the process. </p>

          <p> Having successfully designed a working ammunition-feeding system, I moved on to adding a vertical axis and reworking the stand. I again selected a 35 kg·cm servo for the vertical axis articulation because of
          its high torque and precise position control. At the same time I began developing a basic autonomous tracking code to prove out real-time person tracking with OpenCV. For this design stage I used a Raspberry 
          Pi Pico to handle the servos and trigger logic, and offloaded the vision processing to my PC. The decision for splitting up the processing was done so that heavy image procesing could run without slowing down the actuation of the servos. 
          The images below show the redesign and integration process.

        <p> With all listed objectives completed for our second prototype, I then integrated the ammunition feeding system onto the turret and began full systems testing. The videos below demonstrate this full systems testing. Additionally, the image shows the final CAD model for this second prototype.</p>

        <p> After completing full system tests of the second prototype, I felt confident I had gathered enough feedback and insights to begin the final design of G.U.N.T.H.E.R. From the lessons learned during 
          earlier iterations, I knew the final version needed to look far more professional and visually cohesive—no more mismatched PLA colors. </p>

        <p> One major issue I encountered in previous builds was the horizontal rotation system. The belt-driven setup suffered from significant slippage during fast directional changes, so I planned to replace 
          it with a more robust and reliable mechanism. </p>

        <p> Cable management was another clear area for improvement. In the earlier prototypes, exposed wiring not only looked unrefined but made troubleshooting difficult. For the final version, integrating clean, 
          internal wiring would streamline maintenance and elevate the product’s overall presentation. </p> 

        <p> Another critical upgrade involved the trigger and rev systems. The use of servos introduced noticeable lag and unnecessary complexity. To solve this, I decided to replace them with a fully 
          electronic, relay-based trigger system for faster, more efficient actuation. </p>

        <p> Finally, the existing tripod mount lacked the stability and rigidity required for consistent performance. To address this, I planned to design a new mounting platform that offered a more solid 
          foundation. </p> 

        <p> With these improvements clearly outlined, I jumped into the last phase of G.U.N.T.H.E.R by redesigning the base where the Nerf blaster was mounted. </p>

        <p> To support a more robust horizontal rotation system, I researched various mechanisms before settling on a NEMA 22 stepper motor paired with a micro motorcycle chain drive. I was initially
           wary of using a stepper motor, assuming it lacked torque. However, after digging into how stepper motors work, I found that—when paired with the right gear ratio—it could output up to 18 Nm of 
           torque. Since my calculations showed a maximum required impulse of just 3.31 Nm, this setup was more than sufficient. </p> 

        <p> Having dealt with belt slippage in earlier prototypes, I also chose the chain-and-sprocket system for its superior grip under fast, directional changes. This new base offered the strength and precision
           I needed, setting a solid foundation for the next stage of the build. The images below portray this phase. </p>

        <p> With the new base and horizontal rotation mechanism designed and working the next improvement I addresed was adding electronic controls to the gun. I started this by opening up the Nerf blaster, removing the manufacture's circuitry, and installing my own relays and wiring.
          This process turned out to be one of the more intense parts of the final build as trying to figure out how electrical circuitry works without any schematic is a rather lucritive process. That said, after melting a
          few too many dupont wires, setting off the smoke alarm, and blowing up a relay, I got the blaster rewired and the relays inserted. This process is captured in the videos and images below.

         <p> After rewiring the Nerf blaster with custom circuitry, I moved on to designing the electrical box—where I learned one of the most valuable lessons: your electrical box will 
          always need to be larger than you think. </P>

        <p> For the first version, I designed the box to fit every component with perfect precision. While this seemed ideal from a space-saving perspective, it quickly became impractical. 
          Inevitably, new components needed to be added later, and the lack of extra room left no flexibility for upgrades or modifications. </p>

        <p> Learning from that mistake, I went all out on the final version. I built the box with additional space to accommodate future expansions, integrated wire channels for cleaner 
          routing and easier troubleshooting, made the back board a pin board allowing for modular componet placement, and included terminal blocks. The terminal blocks not only reduced the number of solder joints required but also made the system modular, 
          allowing me to quickly add and test new components by simply plugging them in. The images below show this process, as well as the final electrical box design and instilation. </P>

          <p> After finishing the electrical box, the only mechanical system left to design was the final ammunition feeding system. Since I had already proven the basic design with my 
            second prototype, this step mainly involved creating a housing to integrate the blower system. Because the unit was mounted externally on the turret, I wanted to make sure the 
            design maintained the overall aesthetic. I spent a lot of time adding details to the enclosure so it felt consistent with the rest of the build. </p>

          <p> One of the biggest challenges with this design was the amount of electronics that needed to fit inside the enclosure for the blower to function. A Raspberry Pi Pico, 
            ESC controller, LiPo battery, DC motor controller, DC motor, power terminal, and brushless motor all had to fit in the same space. This meant I had to carefully plan out 
            space allocation and organize components in a way that kept everything functional and accessible. That said, I was really happy with the final product. The images and videos below 
            show the final ammunition feeding system I created. <p>

          <p> With all the mechanical systems complete, the last design challenge I had to tackle was shelling the lower metal box frame of G.U.N.T.H.E.R. This turned out to be 
            one of the more thought-intensive parts of the project because I wanted something that looked futuristic and aesthetically pleasing, while still being lightweight and 
            easy to fabricate. </p>

          <p> I spent a good amount of time considering different approaches, but ultimately settled on a trick often used in video games to make simple geometry look more interesting: 
            layering on lots of decals and surface details. Taking inspiration specifically from Cyberpunk 2077, I designed and laser-cut the panels in my garage, decorating them with random 
            barcodes, safety warnings, and callouts to give the exterior a busy, detailed look. Images of this process are shown below. </p>

        <h3>Print Lock - Project Overview</h3>
        <p>  No college student enjoys locking themselves out of their dorm. As someone who forgets their keys in their room at least once a week, I know that pain all too well. 
          That’s why, over winter break, I decided to spend a week building a solution to this problem. </p>

        <p> I created a biometric door unlocking system that scans my fingerprint, displays the scan on an LCD screen, and, if recognized, unlocks my dorm room using a servo mechanism. 
          This system eliminates the need for keys and provides a convenient and secure way to access my room. </p>

        <p> The project was not only a practical solution to a frequent inconvenience, but it also allowed me to apply my skills in embedded systems, biometric security, and mechanical 
          actuation. It’s been a fun and rewarding experience to see this idea come to life, and it’s already made my daily life much easier!       </p>

        <h3>Split Flap Project Overview</h3>

      <p> Fascinated by the mechanical intricacies of split-flap displays—and determined to succeed after falling short in designing one during my 
        senior year of high school—I decided to spend my freshman summer in college tackling the mechanism that had once defeated me. My goal? To create a fully 
        functional 5-slot split-flap display that could spell my name.</p>

      <p> Along the way, I faced obstacles that tested my patience and problem-solving skills. There were moments when nothing worked, and I felt like giving up. 
        But I stuck with it, and eventually, things started to click—teaching me that progress often feels impossible until it isn’t. If you don’t push through the 
        hard times, you’ll never experience the satisfaction of success.</p>

        <h3>Split Flap Design Process</h3>

        <p> Gear Driven Proto Design Idea - My original design idea for the split-flap mechanism was a gear-driven layout that tucked the stepper motor 
          behind the main assembly to make the package more compact. In testing, however, this configuration significantly reduced the torque delivered 
          to the drive gear and introduced noticeable slop (backlash) into the mechanism, so I ultimately abandoned it for a stiffer, more direct-drive approach. </p>
        
        
          <div class="gallery">
          <img src="./Split Flap - Gear Driven Mechanism.JPG" alt="CAD v1">
          </div>

          <p> Belt Driven Proto Design Idea - After the less then optimal results of the inital gear driven prototype I experimented with a belt driven system
            that positioned the stepper motor behind the main assembly. This was done to create a more compact design then that offered by the bulky gear driven design.
            However, due to the precise tension required for the belts to properly mesh with the gears, this idea was ultimately scrapped in favor of a simpler and 
            more reliable direct-drive mechanism. </p>

            <div class="gallery">
          <img src="./SPlit Flap - Belt Driven Mechanism.JPG" alt="CAD v1">
          </div>

          <p> Final Proto (Direct Drive Mechanism) - The final mechanical mechanism I landed on was the simpelest mechanically, and it opted for
             a direct drive mechanism which afixed the output shaft of the stepper directly to the spindel which all the split flaps were mounted to.
             While this design wasn't as compact as the belt driven mechanism, it significantly reduced slop compared to earlier setups, allowing for a significant increase in precise position control.
             Thus, effectivly allowing me to reliably set letters as desired. Additionally, it made use of a modular micro limit switch mounting cage design which allowed me to streamline the testing phase
             and find the most optimal location for the micro limit switch to achieve precise homing of the split flaps. Once again allowing for reliable letter selection. </P>

      <h3>Robotic Arm Project Overview</h3>

      <p> Having always wanted to design and build my own articulating robotic arm after seeing the J.A.R.V.I.S system in Iron Man 3, I started the creation of this 
        robot over winter break thinking it would be a quick 1-month long project that might help me pick up a few new modeling techniques and sharpen up my coding 
        skills. What has amassed has been a 2+ month long project full of highs, such as the times when the 3D printed CAD models fit together beautifully, and lows, 
        such as the many many hours spent trying to uncover the magic that is using a camera to detect objects. However, despite the good and the bad, I've loved every
         moment of this project and as such would like to highlight a few things I've learned along the way. </p> 

         <p> 1.) My greatest take away was an understanding of the power of object detection with the OpenCV python library. Using this library, I was able to create 
          python code that could detect the position of a ball via camera feed and calculate the up, down, left, and right movements required by 4 servos to center the
           camera on the ball. The amount of autonomous potential a single camera and OpenCV present is befalling, and it has been a major proponent in the successes of
            my robot so far. </p>

        <p> 2.) The importance of understanding component potential before initiating design cannot be stressed enough. Having designed the first prototype around 
          continuous rotation servos, which could only output 15kg of torque at the core, I was forced to later completely redesign the main extension arm and base as 
          well as purchase more-powerful 35 kg non-continues servos when I realized the previously purchased components were not at all rated for the demands of my robot. 
          A mistake I avoided later through better research and a more thorough analysis of the stresses on the components. </p> 
    
        <p> 3.) Accepting that a CAD design, no matter how much time, thought, or effort is put into it, will likely not be perfect on the first attempt. It is best to 
          create rough designs then rework later on. </p>


       <h3>Robotic Arm Design Process</h3>

       <p> Having little experience with a project of this scale at the time, I wasn’t sure where to start. I decided to begin by building a manually controlled prototype to validate the core concept. 
        The most challenging part of the design as this stage was developing the joint motor mechanism for the robotic arm. I needed a solution that was compact, offered precise angle control, 
        and delivered high torque. To tackle this, I researched patents for existing robotic arms and ultimately designed a joint mechanism using internally housed servos connected to an 
        internal gear ring within each joint. The images and videos below show this early prototype. </p>

        <div class="gallery">
           <img src="./Robotic Arm - Internal Joint.JPG" alt="CAD v1">
           <video controls playsinline src="./Robotic Arm - V1 Manual Testing.MOV"></video>
           </div>


        <p> With this first manual control prototype giving me confidence in the general design of the joint motors and arms, I began the next phase of the project, which was looking into how to achieve autonomous tracking.
          Having never used any object detection library befor, I was completly in the dark as to where to start. However, after aproximatly 2 days of failed youtube torturials, I landed on OpencCV. A farley user freidnly
          object detection library which has since become my go to for all projects using object detection. </p>
          
          <p> Having zeroed in on the object detection library I wanted to use, I proved out a basic idea of using an Object Detection script to move servos using a robotic dog I had previously 
            built. The video below shows this proof of concept moment. </p> 
            
           <div class="gallery">
           <video controls playsinline src="./Robotic Arm - Tracking Proved Out.MOV"></video>
           </div>

          <p> With both the mechanical and code based systems proved out, I began working on integrating the autonomous tracking into the robotic arm prototype. My main focuse during this stage was optimizing the code 
           and mechanical mechinsim as much as possible as to allow for maximum speed of tracking. The demo videos below show a few of the speed tests I ran during optimization. </p>

           <div class="gallery">
           <video controls playsinline src="./Robotic Arm - Speed Test 1.MOV"></video>
           <video controls playsinline src="./Robotic Arm - Speed Test 2.MOV"></video>
           </div>
            
            
          
           <p> Generaly satisfied with the operation of the robotic arm's tracking and motion, I began working on addreasing my major dislike with the arm up to this point.
           That being that the base joint lacked an adequte amount of torque as to allow for a payload to be carried at the end effector of the arm. Additionally, this lack of torque reduced how fast the arm could extend and retract.
           So, to address this, I redesigned the base to house 2 35kg*cm servos instead of 1 15kg*cm servo. However, this addition would introduce an unforseen complication for coding. </p>

           <p> By adding a second servo into the gearbox of the robot's base joint, I now effectivly had to figure out a way to get both servos to rotate symeltansoly. On the surface this sounds 
            rather easy as you would assume all servos of the same type rotate at the same speed and increment, but this is not the case. The slight diffrence in rotation speeds 
            was causing grinding of the gears leading to decreased performance and failure at points. To solve this problem, I had to create a code script which used PWM to step each servo incremently in hundreds of 
            tiny steps until the desired angle was achieved. The video below shows the successful solving of this problem.  </P> 


            <div class="gallery">
           <video controls playsinline src="./Robotic Arm - Synching Rotation .MOV"></video>
           </div>

           <p> With the servo synching problem solved in the base joint, and now having an adequate amount of torque for moving a payload at the end effector of the arm, I began working on designing a robotic claw to attach to the end. 
            I knew this claw was going to need a fair amount of dextarity for grabing small objects, so I made use of six micro servos for articulating the claw joints. Additionally, to determine the relative proximity of an object 
            in relation to the claw I integrated an ultrasonic sensor into it. This allowed for the arm to autonomously grab objects only when they were actually close enough to be grabbed. The images and videos
             below show the design proces of this claw. </p>

           <div class="gallery">
           <video controls playsinline src="./Robotic Arm - Initial Claw Test.MOV"></video>

           <img src="./Robotic Arm - Claw Image 1.JPG" alt="CAD v1">
           </div>

          <p> After several iterations, I was finally satisfied with the operation of the claw and integrated it onto the robotic arm. At this point I was on the home stretch for the project and all that was left was 
            tieing up lose ends in the code. That said, the following images show the final result of this project. </p>
